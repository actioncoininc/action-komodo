## Action Coin

This is the OLD Action Coin repository.  It is OUT OF DATE, PLEASE DO NOT USE!  This software is based on [Komodo Platform Technology](https://komodoplatform.com/).  If you wish to run a node on our network, build the latest version of Komodo Core:

https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo

And launch with the following connection parameters in order to sync with the Action Coin Network:
